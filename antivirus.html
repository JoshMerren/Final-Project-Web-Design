                <p><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/antivirus.jpg" alt="Hand holding shield"><p class="home_info">   What exactly is antivirus software designed to do? We're talking about a program or umbrella of programs whose purpose is to scan for and eradicate computer viruses and other malicious software, also known as malware. Antivirus software is a vital component of your overall online and computer security strategy in its protection against data and security breaches along with other threats.

                When looked at simply, a computer virus is similar to a cold virus. It's designed to go from one computer or device to the next, copying itself, and spreading malicious codes and programs that can damage and infiltrate your operating systems. Viruses are designed to give criminals access to their victims' devices.
                    
                These viruses, spyware, and other malicious software are known as malware, and can be surreptitiously installed on your computer or device. Malware can do everything from crashing your device to monitoring or controlling your online activity. This control may enable hackers to send spam and steal your private information, which could eventually lead to identity theft.
                    
                Antivirus software provides protection against these types of threats by performing key tasks:
                <ul id="anti_list">
                <li>Pinpointing specific files for the detection of malicious software</li>
                <li>Scheduling automatic scans</li> 
                <li>Scanning either one file or your entire computer at your discretion</li>
                <li>Deleting malicious codes and software</li>
                <li>Confirming the safety of your computer and other devices</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p class="home_info">As cybercrime evolves and becomes more sophisticated, whether it's your own PC or other devices on a larger network, you don't want to leave yourself or your network vulnerable. If you don't have security software, you could be opening the door for cybercriminals to gain access to your most sensitive information — and potentially garner control over your computer and mobile devices.The beauty of malware for hackers is its ability to gain access to or damage a computer without our knowledge. It's important to be aware of the many different types of malicious codes, or “malware,” against which antivirus software is designed to protect:
                <ul id="anti_list2">
                <li>Spyware: stealing sensitive information</li>
                <li>Ransomware: extorting money</li><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/antivirus2.jpeg" alt="Bug being crossed out">
                <li>Viruses</li>
                <li>Worms: spreading copies between computers </li>
                <li>Trojans: promising one thing but delivering another </li>
                <li>Adware: advertising</li>
                <li>Spam: spreading unwanted email</li></p></p>
                </ul>
                <h1 class ="title">Free antivirus software: Does it work?</h1>
                <p class="home_info"> Another common question is whether free antivirus software protects us. But is anything ever really free? “Free” antivirus inevitably supports and makes money with advertising and tracking, and by installing junkware.

                Free downloads also can hide malware. If you go this route, only download software from sites that you absolutely trust. You also must ensure that your security setting is set high enough to detect malicious codes.
                    
                Another thing to keep in mind when considering whether to rely on free antivirus protection? Identity theft protection, mobile security, and data security support options. These important security features often are lacking with free software.</p>
