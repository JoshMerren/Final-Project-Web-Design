                        <p><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/ransomware2.jpeg" alt="typing on keyboard"><p class="home_info"><strong> Ransomware -</strong> Ransomware is a malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their computer. By encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, cyberattackers place organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest way to regain access to their files. Some variants have added additional functionality - such as data theft - to provide further incentive for ransomware victims to pay the ransom.

                        Ransomware has quickly become the most prominent and visible type of malware. Recent ransomware attacks have impacted hospitals' ability to provide crucial services, crippled public services in cities, and caused significant damage to various organizations.</p>
    
                        
                        <p class="home_info"><strong>Adware -</strong><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/adware.jpeg" alt="typing on keyboard"> Adware is software that displays unwanted (and sometimes irritating) pop-up adverts which can appear on your computer or mobile device. Adware typically ends up on a user's device through one of two ways:
                            <ul id="attack_list">
                            <li>You might install a free computer program or app without necessarily realizing that it contains additional software that contains adware. This allows the app developer to make money but means you could download adware onto your systems without necessarily consenting.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, there may be a vulnerability in your software or operating system which hackers exploit to insert malware, including some types of adware, into your system.</li>  
                            </ul>
                        <p class="home_info"><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/spyware.jpeg" alt="typing on keyboard"><strong>Spyware -</strong> Although it sounds like a James Bond gadget, it's actually a type of malware that infects your PC or mobile device and gathers information about you, including the sites you visit, the things you download, your usernames and passwords, payment information, and the emails you send and receive.

                        No big surprise—spyware is sneaky. It finds its way on to your computer without your knowledge or permission, attaching itself to your operating system. You might even inadvertently permit spyware to install itself when you agree to the terms and conditions of a seemingly legitimate program without reading the fine print.</p><br>
    
                        <p class="home_info"><strong>Phishing -</strong><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/phishing.png" alt="typing on keyboard"> Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.

                        The information is then used to access important accounts and can result in identity theft and financial loss </p><br>
    
                        <p class="home_info"><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/keylogger.jpeg" alt="typing on keyboard"><strong>Keylogger</strong> Keyloggers are also known as keystroke loggers. This is a program that runs all the time on your computer from the minute that you start it up. The keylogger will either record every keystroke you make or just those made in specific fields on websites.

                        Keyloggers don't slow down your computer and you won't even notice when one is in operation. Windows 10 even has a keylogger built into the operating system. Although there are some legitimate uses of keyloggers, such as in the workplace, or to track the internet activities of children, you are also at risk of these programs turning your computer into a spy for hackers.
                            
                        Keyloggers can embed themselves into the operating system of your computer. These types of malware are called “rootkit” viruses. There are types of keyloggers that can even work at a lower level than the operating system. These are known as “hypervisor malware.” A keylogger may attach itself to your browser as a hidden extension and just report on all of the keystrokes that you make through that app. Other keyloggers manage to infect web pages, so everyone that visits those pages gets their data stolen.</p>
