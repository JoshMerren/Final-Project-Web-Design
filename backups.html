There are a few different options.Use an external hard drive to backup your files. You can do a full system backup of your files using Time Machine (Mac) or Windows Backup and Restore and/or File History. These backups need to be done on an external hard drive. If you're backing up a Mac using Time Machine, you will need to use a hard drive that is formatted for Mac (you can either buy them pre-formatted, or format the drive using Disk Utility).

                    Now, the issue with the external hard drive is it's often in the same physical location as your computer. So if there's a fire or theft, there's a good chance that your backups are gone with your computer and no longer helpful to you.
                        
                    The best way to backup your files would be to use an online service like Crash Plan, IDrive, Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox etc.</p><br>

                    <p class="home_info"><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/backups3.gif" alt="selecting backups on phone">Mobile Device Backups Thinking of how many pictures you have on your phone right nowâ€¦any special memories you would hate to lose? This happens all too often because people aren't backing up their mobile phones or tablets. Many assume their provider or manufacturer can somehow get their photos back from a lost, stolen or damaged phone, but unless the device is backed up, this is incorrect.</p>

                    <p class="home_info">iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches have two options for backup. Either using iCloud or iTunes. Backing up to iCloud will likely require the purchase of additional iCloud storage (iCloud comes with only 5GB of storage). An iTunes backup requires you to plug your iPhone, iPad or iPod into your computer and create a backup there. Keep in mind, if you don't have a backup of your computer as well, if something happens to your mobile device and computer, you have no backups.</p>

                    <p class="home_info">Android Phones and Tablets and The easiest way to backup an Android phone or tablet is through Google. Backup options can be found in the settings of your phone/tablet. You can also backup to your computer by setting your phone to be read as a removable storage device (your computer sees your phone/tablet similar to a USB drive).</p>
