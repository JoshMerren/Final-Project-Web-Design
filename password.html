                    <p><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/passwords4.jpeg" alt="Purple lock"><p class="home_info"><strong>   Make passports long, complex, and unique.</strong>  This is the best way to minimize the risk of cyber crime is to have long, complex, unique and well-managed passwords. Meeting the minimum password requirements for a password is not enough. Today, an eight-character password is considered weak; the recommendation is at least twelve—and use a mix of capitals, numbers, and symbols. If the app or tool you're protecting does not allow for 12 characters, make your password as long as is allowed. Also note that replacing letters with digits or symbols (d1git5 & $ymb0ls) does little to make your password more secure, as it is well known technique by hackers and addressed by most hacking tools.</p>

                    
                    <p class="home_info"><strong>Use a password generator.</strong> Instead of asking people to try to come up with a strong password, you can use a password manager like <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a> or <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>, which have password generators. Those passwords are virtually impossible to crack.</p>   
                    
                    <p class="home_info"><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/passwords2.png" alt="Diagram with the speed it takes to crack a password"><strong>Use a passphrase.</strong> If you are unable to use a password manager, use a passphrase, which is simply a longer password. It can even be a sentence with spaces and punctuation. The benefit of passphrases is that typically they are easier to remember but more difficult to crack due to their length. Consider these two passwords: “ArcherPointIsSafe” and “ArcherPoint Is Safe!”. It would take a modern computer approximately 19 days to crack the first password and more than 1,500 YEARS to crack the second because the time increases exponentially with each additional character…a big deterrent to cyber crime.</p><br>

                    <p class="home_info"><strong>Use multiform factor authentication.</strong> You're probably seeing this more and more lately. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an electronic authentication method that requires two or more pieces of evidence (factors)—typically something only the user knows, has, or is. For example, access to a tool might require a password like you would typically see, plus a code sent via text to the user's cell phone or generated through an authenticator app. This approach simply adds another layer to the authentication process that would be very difficult for a hacker to guess.</p>

                    <p class="home_info"><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/passwords3.gif" alt="Password managers with names"><strong>Use a password manager.</strong> Keeping track of longer, more complicated passwords can feel inconvenient, but the benefits far outweigh any inconvenience when it comes to preventing cyber crime. Password managers remove any inconvenience without compromising security. In an ideal world, you only remember two passwords: one for your password manager and the other for your computer (if you don't have advanced security features such as Face ID or Windows Hello). A password manager also makes keeping unique logins simple, reducing the impact if you are compromised.</p>
