                    <p><img class="border-gradient border-gradient-purple" src="photos/unauthorized2.jpeg" alt="Giant No authorized acess sign"><p class="update_info">  Unauthorized access is when your computer or device is invaded without your consent. Most people protect their computers with some type of access control, like using a password or biometric solution. But, people don't always protect their other devices.<br>

                        Smartphones, small devices that are constantly online sending and receiving signals, are always a target for criminals. To help protect yourself from cybercrime you need to keep your device secure. Always enable a lock screen on your devices whether you access it with a password, a pattern, or any other method. Always avoid public Wi-Fi. Use your data from your service provider.<br>
                        
                        Always use a VPN solution on all your devices when in a public setting. VPNs help to protect you and your data from being compromised. A VPN can protect you from cybercrime and malicious actors. Also, consider disabling Bluetooth while you're out and about unless you are wearing a smartwatch that requires it. And never pair a new device when in a public area.<br>
                        
                        Tip: Make a habit of restarting your personal devices on a weekly basis. It helps protect against some type of hacker attacks. </p>
